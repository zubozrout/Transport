# Transport
Ubuntu Phone Transport Application - Czech and Slovak public transport schedules + European trains + Airlines.

This is a Ubuntu Phone application for searching connections for public transport - mostly in the Czech and Slovak republic.
It uses API provided by CHAPS s.r.o. company.

Please note I can't share the private key used by this app - therefore using the code present in this repository will only allow you to use free API.
The real Ubuntu Phone app present in the store here https://uappexplorer.com/app/transport.zubozrout contains the private key.

Here is the CHAPS API documentation: http://docs.crws.apiary.io/#reference
